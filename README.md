# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Project Context

Instacart is an online, app-driven grocery store seeking more detailed information on their sales patterns. Stakeholders desire a targeted marketing strategy based on customer purchasing behaviors. Python was primarily used to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis for better segmentation based on provided criteria for targeted marketing to its customers.

## Key Questions

- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Are there simpler price range groupings to help direct marketing efforts?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- How do the ordering behaviors of different types of customers differ?
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
